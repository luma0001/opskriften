        <b>Huang Men Ji (黄焖鸡)</b>
        <p>>>Huang Men Ji<< means “yellow braised chicken” in Chinese. Yellow
        refers to the color of the gravy. It’s usually thick and gets its color
        from ginger and garnish like potato, carrot, or chestnut. “Men” refers
        to the cooking technique – braising. And Ji means chicken. As a popular
        dish in Shandong Province, the dish tastes stronger than those in
        Southern China. That’s why it goes so well with rice and noodles.
        Despite its popularity today, Huang Men Ji didn’t get much attention
        until the year 2013. Because Huang Men Ji tastes good and has everything
        in one bowl, it soon became viral nationwide. The chicken, the
        vegetable, the rice, and the gravy come together to make it a
        restaurant-level fast food. On top of that, it doesn’t require much time
        and skills to make Huang Men Ji; tens of thousands of restaurants put it
        on their menus. By 2021, it is estimated that there are more than 10,000
        restaurants in China that serve Chinese braised chicken only.</p>

            <h3>Preparations</h3>

          
            <ol>
            <li>
              Chop the chicken into medium-size pieces that are about 1" thick.
              Rinse with water.
            </li>
            <li>Wash and peel the fresh ginger. Then slice it thinly.</li>
            <li>
              Rinse the scallions and remove the roots. Then separate the white
              and the green parts. Chop them into 2" pieces in length.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut the green pepper in half. Remove the core and the seeds. Then
              slice the pepper into small strips.
            </li>
            <li>Chop the chestnuts in half so they are cooked more quickly.</li>
            <li>
              Wash the mushrooms thoroughly and slice them into about 4 pieces
              each.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are using dried mushrooms, soak in warm water first and
              remove the stems before cutting. The stems can be too tough to
              chew.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring a pot of water to a boil. Then blanch the chicken for about
              3 minutes. Blanching will help remove the impurities of the
              chicken, so it picks up the sauce's flavor better. Once done,
              transfer to a plate to cool down.
            </li>

<h3>Braising</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat one tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat on a pan.
              Place the ginger slices and the white scallion stems in the pan
              when the oil starts to smoke and sauté until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add chestnuts to the pan and sauté for two minutes. When the
              vegetables start to brown, add chicken, mushrooms, and Shaoxing
              wine. Stir-fry for two minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour water to soak all ingredients. Then add light soy sauce, dark
              soy sauce, and soybean paste. Stir to season the ingredients
              evenly. When the liquid boils, cover the pan with a lid and reduce
              the heat to medium-low. Stew for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add peppers and stew for another 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix 1
              teaspoon of cornstarch or regular flour with half a cup of water
              to thicken the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the peppers soften, add the cornstarch to the pan and
              sprinkle with green scallions. Turn turn heat up to medium and
              swiftly stir the ingredients. The sauce will start to turn into
              yellowish gravy. Transfer to a plate and serve with rice or Chow
              Mien.
            </li>
